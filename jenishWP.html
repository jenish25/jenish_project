          <h2 id="1">About The All New SWIFT</h2>
          <ul>
          <div>
          <li>January 12, 2017 – First launched in 2005, Swift’s success is attributed to sporty looks, frugal engine choices and affordable pricing. Giving a stiff competition to rivals in the segment, the hatchback offers value for money. Maruti has been consistently upgrading the model and is prepping yet again to transit it into the next generation. The 2017 Maruti Swift will witness extensive change over the model it precedes, inclusive of aesthetic changes, mechanical updates and new on-board equipment. Talking of the aesthetic changes, it will receive radical changes, transforming the entire look. While the basic silhouette has been carried forward, the overall design has evolved with edgy elements adding to the visual appearance.
          From what we know so far, the new generation Swift will be largely similar to the global model revealed lately in Japan, but it may vary in terms of equipment. Following suit, interior will be a step-up compared to the current model donning a sporty look and new tech including a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay etc on the range topping variants. It is to be noted that the interior layout on the India-spec model is likely to be different from the global model. Sharing underpinnings with Baleno, the 2017 Maruti Swift will be lighter aiding improved performance and higher fuel economy. Check Out – 2017 Maruti Suzuki Swift Photo Gallery  </li>

           <ul><div ><li>Dual airbags are believed to be offered as standard across all variants for improved safety quotient and the cabin space will be slightly increased as well due to the Swift being based on the Baleno’s platform which also makes it 15 percent lighter than the premium hatchback.The global version of Swift measures 3,840 mm in length, 1,695 mm in width, 1,525 mm in height and features a wheelbase of 2,450 mm. Compared to the India-spec current model, it is 10 mm smaller, 5 mm shorter and has 20 mm more wheelbase. The bootspace capacity stands at 205 litres and fuel tank that can load up to 42 litres should remain the same as the outgoing model. The platform the new Swift will be built on is 15 percent lighter than Baleno that weighs 890 kilograms and 10 percent more rigid.</li>

        <h2 id="3"><br>Launching in INDIA</a></h2>
        <ul>
        <div ><li>The 2017 Maruti Suzuki Swift has been launched in Japan and it will go on sale there from January 4. It is expected to be launched in mid-2018 in India, probably by August 2018, to follow the new-gen Dzire slated for late-2017.</li>

        <div ><li>Based on the fourth generation global model, India could be one of the first countries to receive the new car after Europe. Maruti’s Gujarat manufacturing facility is more likely to export new Swift hatchback to several Asian and European nations as well as producing it for domestic market.</li>

        <h2 id="4"><br>Estimate Price:</h2>
        <ul>
        <div><li>While the Japanese market will be the first ones to receive the new-generation Swift on 4th January next year, we do expect to see it here during 2017 festive season. We’ll update our readers on this as soon as the company reveals an official release date.
        The Japan bound new-gen Swift is priced at Rs ¥1.3 million for the base 2WD variant and goes up to ¥1.9 million for the top-of-the-line 4WD hybrid variant. In Indian currency, the new Swift price for the Japanese model ranges from Rs 7.75 lakh to Rs 11.21 lakh. Thankfully, the one meant for the Indian market will cost as high as the Japan-spec model. That said the estimated new Maruti Swift price in India could start from Rs 5 lakh for the entry level variant. On the other hand, the fully- loaded range topping variant could be priced at Rs 8 lakh. Also Read – Upcoming Maruti Suzuki Cars in India</li>
